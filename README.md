### Instructions for installing and testing the sfml graphics library on Linux taken from link below and slightly modified:
( https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/start-linux.php )

`sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev`

g++ -c filename.cpp -std=c++11

g++ object_file.o -o output_name -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -std=c++11

So far I've gotten nr 16, Asteroids to work. Nothing had to be changed.
